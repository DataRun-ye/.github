# Project Status Update

**Current Progress:**
- The main API endpoints have been successfully built, providing robust backend support for form management and data collection.
- The Flutter Android app is operational, enabling users to log in, download forms, and submit data. Key features like form entry, data synchronization, and user authentication are functioning as expected.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue refining the backend with additional dynamic features, such as adding JSONB properties to entities.
- Expand the toolset for API management to enhance data handling and project management capabilities.
- Begin user testing and gather feedback to optimize the app's user experience.
