# C# Tools for DataRun's API Management
This project provides a collection of C# tools designed to interact with and manage the API. These tools allow for basic operations such as importing, saving, updating, and creating entities. They are intended to serve as a temporary solution for API management until a full front-end interface is developed.

## Features

- **Import Data:** Import data from various sources into the API.
- **Create Entities:** Easily create new entities in the API.
- **Update Entities:** Update existing entities with new data.
- **Save Data:** Save changes to entities in the API.
