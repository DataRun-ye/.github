# Data Run API Management Tools

## Overview

This repository contains a set of C# tools designed to interact with and manage our API before the full front-end implementation is complete. These tools enable basic operations such as importing, saving, updating, and creating entities.

## Tools

### 1. **Import Tool**
   - **Purpose:** Import data into the API from various sources.
   - **Usage:** Configure the source file and run the tool to automatically import data into the specified entity.

### 2. **Save Tool**
   - **Purpose:** Save new entities to the API.
   - **Usage:** Define the entity details in the configuration, and the tool will handle saving it to the API.

### 3. **Update Tool**
   - **Purpose:** Update existing entities in the API.
   - **Usage:** Specify the entity ID and new data, and the tool will perform the update.

### 4. **Create Tool**
   - **Purpose:** Create new entities in the API.
   - **Usage:** Provide the necessary details for the new entity, and the tool will manage the creation process.

## Future Work

This set of tools is a temporary solution until the full Angular front-end is developed.
